Webinar resources

Join us for an interactive webinar designed for cybersecurity professionals and cloud enthusiasts looking to enhance their threat-hunting capabilities. In this session, we will explore how to build a dynamic cyber range in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). A cyber range is a simulated environment where organizations can test their defenses, train teams, and uncover vulnerabilities.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:
Leverage OCI Observability tools like Cloud Guard, Logging, and Logging Analytics to monitor and analyze threats.
Integrate powerful open-source tools such as OSQuery, Arkime, and Suricata for real-time threat detection and analysis.
Simulate realistic attack scenarios in the cyber range to strengthen incident response skills.
Build a seamless workflow to correlate logs from multiple sources, detect anomalies, and proactively address Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).This hands-on webinar is perfect for SOC analysts, IT administrators, and security architects aiming to build robust, scalable security operations using OCI and open-source technologies.
